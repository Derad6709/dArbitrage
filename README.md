# dArbitrage

Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from an imbalance in the price. dArbitrage (iOS) allows you to exploit price differences that exist between Kyber Network and Bancor markets.

The app was created as a hackathon project at ETHSanFrancisco Oct, 2018.
